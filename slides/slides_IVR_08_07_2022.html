**The standard way**: *start with texts published in journals from a given area*. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;



**But**: &lt;br&gt;
.list2[
    * important texts in legal philosophy are often published outside specialist journals;
* key texts in legal philosophy are often books.

**Alternative approach**:

    * start with texts published in specialist journals *or* classified in *philpapers.org*;
* add most cited or citing articles;
* based on patterns of co-citations, identify the core of such a collection.
